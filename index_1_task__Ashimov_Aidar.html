				<td><big>The LaFerrari Aperta is a limited version (210 units) of the LaFerrari. Initially, 200 cars were sold with an additional nine reserved for use during the Ferrari 70th Anniversary celebrations. One more model was later sold by auction. The LaFerrari Aperta comes with a removable carbon-fibre hard top and a removable soft top. Other changes include more efficient powertrain's control electronics, re-angled radiators to direct air flow out along the underbody rather than over the bonnet, a longer front air dam to help boost downforce, a L-shaped flap on the upper corner of each windscreen pillar to reduce compression on the rear of the cabin in the absence of a roof, different butterfly door angles with different wheel arches and a new carbon fibre insert allowing the doors to rotate.The car was unveiled at the 2016 Paris Auto Show. Like past convertible Ferrari models, it uses the Aperta label to denote its removable roof. According to Ferrari, all units were already sold to customers via invitation.The LaFerrari, project name F150 (also unofficially referred to as the Ferrari LaFerrari or Ferrari F70) is a limited production hybrid sports car built by Italian automotive manufactuter Ferrari. LaFerrari literally means "The Ferrari" in Italian and in some other Romance languages, in this context in the sense that it is the "definitive" Ferrari.Because the car does not have a roof, Ferrari’s technicians had to focus all their ingenuity on the lower section which had to be reinforced because it is subject to different stresses caused by force lines which, in the coupé, converge in the upper part.Thanks to a series of targeted modifications designed to reinforce that area to cope with the new stresses, allow the LaFerrari Aperta deliver the same torsional rigidity figure as the LaFerrari, thus putting the Aperta at the top of supercar category in terms of dynamic performance.</big> </td>
